  BAYERPAT in FITS does not depend on "Rotation" property anymore (force_Rotation has no effect anymore),
  but Bayer pattern can now be forced with force_BayerOrder

- saving and loading configurations
- bug fix: after aborting an exposure the camera stayed busy and EKOS field solver could not start a new exposure

- fixed division by 0 when focal length equals 0
- improved driver exit when indiserver is closed (to avoid driver continue to run)
